# My Boss

## About

This is software that tells me what to do and when to do it. It's my boss. Some might call it an ERP system, but there's nothing "enterprise" about it.

My Boss is a command-line application that stores its data in local files. It's designed to be used together with Git or another version control system, to assure proper management of its data.

## Status

At the time of writing, literally nothing but this README exists.
